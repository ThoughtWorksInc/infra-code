Digital innovation economy:
  Agile brings business closer to development

  The pace of disruption is accelerating
  The Inseparability of Functionality and Operability
  Silo-based organizations and manual processes still create waste that impede the ability to deliver continuous change and conduct continuous experiments.
  User experience software as unified hole (function + operation)
  Devops + Cloud = Enable continuous experimentation

  There is DevOps witout Cloud
  There is Cloud without DevOps


Lock-in:
  Software, product or supplier lock-in
  If you only opt for supporting the lowest common denominator, sometimes you can miss out on many other value add features offered by cloud providers
  Increase portability by creating modular architectures on top of cloud infrastructure
  Obvious costs vs more obscure costs (maintain and develop your own solutions)
  Switching costs
  Be careful when embracing tools that "do everything"
  Separete infrastructure provisioning (terraform, cloudformation...) from configuration management (ansible, puppet)

Switching costs:
  Snowflake servers
  The one guy that knows how it works
